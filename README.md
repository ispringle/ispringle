### Hello there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Ian Pringle. I'm a self-taught software engineer with strong operations skills and experience. I am really passionate about technological minimalism, subscribe to the UNIX philosophy of software design and try to incorporate that into the things I do daily at work and in my personal technical pursuits. I'm a huge fan of the programming language Rust but also love learning & collecting new and interesting languages. I've spent some time with lots of different languages, some of my favorites, besides Rust, are Nim, Haskell, SBL, and Python.

- ðŸ§° I use emacs(+evil-mode), ion-shell, and dwm for nearly all my work
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning PicoLISP and Clojure
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking to help with Rust projects
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: pard@0x44.pw
- âš¡ Fun fact: I live 30 minutes from cell reception
