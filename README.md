### Hello there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Ian Pringle. I'm a systems administrator with strong development skills. I am really passionate about technological minimalism, subscribe to the UNIX philosophy of software design and try to incorporate that into the things I do daily at work and in my personal technical pursuits. I'm a huge fan of the programming language Rust but also love learning new and interesting languages. I've spent some time with lots of different languages, some of my favorites, besides Rust, are Nim, Haskell, SBL, and Python. 

In fact, I feel as if in large part I owe my entire career to Python. I was stuck in a dead-end data entry job when I had the thought that I should be able to just automate my job. I started with this thing I found called AutoHotkey and after surpassing the capabilities of that wonderful software I found a post on Stack Overflow (which at that point I'd never even heard of) suggesting that I try using Python. A couple weeks later I had a small Python program running that would assist with some of the more monotonous data entry stuff and by the end of the second month I'd setup a small database in SQLite3 and had my program logging what I did there, so I could later go back over that after my weekly reviews and amend my data to align with the assessments, and then use this ammended data to make more informed decisions in the future. 

I eventually was found out and told to stop using my automation software, so I got a job with my company's Helpdesk and started writing automation tooling for them when I wasn't helping out customers. That in turn led me to a promotion and the permission to take my automation writing full-time, and I was able to write a small tool to assist Helpdesk agents take phone calls, perform tasks to assist the user, and document their phone calls in Service Now.

This, and the visibility I got by being noisy and asking for things, helped me move into a position with the NOC where I was able to leverage my Linux knowledge and automation experience to create a number of tools to drastically cut the time needed for a number of daily tasks. I now work for our Observability team, and get to play in Kubernetes all day, write Ansible roles, and assist other teams and departments in fully leveraging out suite of observability tools to best see how their services are performing, where things need to be improved, and hopefully catch would-be incidents well in advanced.
