* Hello there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Ian S. Pringle. I'm a full-stack operator, which is a tongue in cheek
way of saying that I am as competent writing software as I am setting up Linux
boxes, managing Kubernetes, or designing systems.

I'm an engineer at Hydrobuilder, and I am the owner/operator of a farm.
